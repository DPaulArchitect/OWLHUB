This is a small project I am working on in my free time. I like birds of prey but quite like Owls, since there are over 200 species lf Owl there is an Owl to suit everyone! Such Amazing birds. 
Anyway back to the Project. 
This is a mobile application I am making using React. I chose react for its multi platform capabilities and use of javascript. 

App update.
pages created, user profile, postscreen, home, owlinfo and market place.
basic wireframe and navigation added. 

Dependencies Required.
1)
react: The main React library.
2)
react-native: The React Native framework for building mobile apps.
3)
@react-navigation/native: The main React Navigation library for handling navigation in React Native apps.
4)
@react-navigation/bottom-tabs: The bottom tab navigator component from React Navigation for managing tabs at the bottom of the screen.

To install these dependencies, you can run the following commands:
npm install react react-native @react-navigation/native @react-navigation/bottom-tabs 		

Additionally, React Navigation requires some additional dependencies for its native functionality. You can install them using the following command:
expo install react-native-screens react-native-safe-area-context 		

If you're using Expo, you'll also need to install the following dependency:
expo install @react-native-community/masked-view 	

If you're not using Expo, you can install the required native modules for your platform (iOS or Android) by following the instructions in the React Navigation documentation: <https://reactnavigation.org/docs/getting-started/>
