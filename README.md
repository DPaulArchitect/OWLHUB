This is a small project I am working on in my free time. I like birds of prey but quite like Owls, since there are over 200 species lf Owl there is an Owl to suit everyone! Such Amazing birds. 
Anyway back to the Project. 
This is a mobile application I am making using React. I chose react for its multi platform capabilities and use of javascript. 

App update.
pages created, user profile, postscreen, home, owlinfo and market place.
basic wireframe and navigation added.
